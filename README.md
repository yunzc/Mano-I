# Mano-I
=========
First prototype of drawing/writing robotic hand quickly put toghter with servo, arduino, and wood. 
Arduino controlled with Matlab 

Execution order >> 
-launcharduino 
-load desired image in traceoutline
-run listofcoordinate for arduino to write 

%Yet to be able to distinguish between line and faces 
%Hardware limits accuracy
